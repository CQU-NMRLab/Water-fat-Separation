***** Setup instructions *****

Make sure the following are in your MATLAB path:
knee data
phantom data


***** Notes *****

If you want to understand the water/fat separation effect of phantom, please compile mainpriorSE_T2x.m and mainpriorGRE_T2x.m.

If you want to understand the water/fat separation effect of knee, please compile knee_GRE.m and knee_GRE2.m.
